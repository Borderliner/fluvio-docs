# Run Connectors on the Cloud

Check [the Hub] for a library of certified connectors that you can download and run. If the connector you need isn't available, you can [build your own]. This document will guide you through downloading and running a certified connector from the Hub on your local machine.


## Download from Hub & Run Locally

In this example, we'll create new directory to download and run the `acme/my-connector0.1.0` connector locally:


```bash copy="fl"
$ mkdir test-conn; cd test-conn
```

Download the connector:


```bash copy="fl"
$ cdk hub download acme/my-connector0.1.0
```

Use connector `.ipkg` package file and run it with the `--ipkg` option:


```bash copy="fl"
$ cdk deploy start --ipkg acme/my-connector0.1.0.ipkg --config ../sample-config.yaml
```

This command assumes that the sample config is in the parent directory.

See the command reference for [`cdk`]

## Run an Official Connector in the InfinyOn Cloud

With only the config file, a published connector can be run directly in the [InfinyOn Cloud].
Check the [connector documentation] to ensure the [configuration file] is correct. The configs
are the same between a local instance and the cloud.

`fluvio cloud connector create -c sample-config.yaml`

See the command reference for [`fluvio cloud connector`]
